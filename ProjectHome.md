# Introduction #
_Lineage Sequence Discovery_ is program made in Perl, using the Gtk2+ toolkit, that aims to simplify the discovery of patterns within biological sequences.

This project is being made under the context of an integration in research grant, sponsored by the [FCT](http://alfa.fct.mctes.pt/). [Diogo Costa](http://diogocosta.pt.tl/), who received the grant, is working on the project under the supervision of [Jorge Vieira](mailto:jbvieira@ibmc.up.pt) and [Nuno Fonseca](mailto:nf@ibmc.up.pt) at Instituto de Biologia Molecular e Celular ([IBMC](http://www.ibmc.up.pt/)).

Some external tools are used:
  * [SigDis](http://cracs.fc.up.pt/~nf/projects/sigdis/), by [Nuno Fonseca](http://cracs.fc.up.pt/~nf/), is used to find search patterns in order to get the best results when searching.
  * A simple graphical interface to [T-Coffee](http://www.tcoffee.org/Projects_home_page/t_coffee_home_page.html) is also included, to allow the alignment of the positive and negative files from the graphical interface.
